### IAM policies Inheritance:
* Every user in a group inherits the policies of that group
* A policy that is only attached to an individual user is called an inline policy
* If a user belongs to multiple groups. That user inherits the policies of all the groups they are a part of. <img src = "..\Images\Pasted image 20231025113143.png"></img>
### IAM Policy Structure
* Consists of :
	* **Version**: Policy language version.
	* **ID**: an identifier for the policy (optional)
	* **Statement**: one or more statements. It consists of:
		* **Sid**: and identifier for the statement (optional)
		* **Effect**: whether the statement allows or denies access.
		* **Principal**: Account/ user/ role to which the policy applies
		* **Action**: list of actions this policy allows or denies
		* **Resource**: list of resources to which the actions applied to
	* **Condition**(not on image): conditions for when this policy is in effect.(optional)

Syntax notes:
* a star * in the place of an action or resource means all actions or resources. So an admin might have all actions for all resources allowed.

You can create your own policies either textually in the json or with the visual editor in the IAM policy console</md-block>
