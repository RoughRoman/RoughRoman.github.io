You can use different types of EC2 Instances that are optimised for different use cases

### naming conventions
Example:
m5.2xlarge 
* m : instance class
* 5 : generation. ( Aws improves them )
* 2xlarge : size with the instance class 


# categories:
### general purpose 
* great for diversity of workloads such as web servers. 
* balance between compute, memory, and networking capabilities 
* Example is the t2.micro which is a general purpose EC2 instance.

### Compute Optimized
* Great for compute intensive tasks that require high performance CPUs 
* like batch processing, media transcoding, game servers, high performance computing (HPC) etc
* Generally they have names that start with a C like C6g


### Memory optimized
* Fast performance for workloads that require large data sets in memory 
* Like in-memory databases 
* distributed web scale cache stores 
* Real time processing of big unstructured data.
* like R series R6g


### Storage optimized
* Good for storage intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage. 
* used for High frequency on-line transaction processing (OLTP) systems, Or data warehousing, or distributed file systems , or traditional relational databases/nosql databases.</md-block>
