Amazon Machine Image
- represent a customization of an EC2 instance
- You add your own software, config, OS, monitoring
- Fast boot/ config time because all the software is pre-packed
- AMIs are built for a specific region (but can be copied across regions)
- You can launce EC2 instances from a public AMI which is AWS provided. e.g. Amazon Linux 2
- We can of course create your own, but then you need to maintain them as well.
- You can also launch an EC2 instance from an AMI from the marketplace. could be paid or free. 
### Process of creating an AMI
- Start an EC2 instance and customize it
- Stop the instance for data integrity
- Build an AMI from it which creates EBS snapshots behind the scenes
- Launch instances from this or other AMIs</md-block>
