        <md-block>- A global application is an application deployed in multiple geographies
- On AWS: this could be Regions and/or Edge locations
- Decreased latency
	- Latency is time it takes for a network packet to reach a server
	- Deploying an application physically closer to the end users will decrease latency and provide a better experience
- Disaster Recovery (DR)
	- If an AWS region goes down (Natural disaster or political instability etc). You can then fail-over to another region and your application will still work.
	- A DR plan is important to increase the availability of your application
- Attack protection: Distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack
