- Provides better I/O performance than EBS since it is physically co-located to an EC2s physical host computer.
- Good choice for high disk performance.
- EC2 instance store lose their storage if they are stopped. (Ephemeral)
- Cant be used as a durable long term storage
- Good for a cache, buffer, temp data etc.
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails. 
- Your responsibility to back up   it does fail.
