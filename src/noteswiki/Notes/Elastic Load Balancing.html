- Load Balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) downstream
- Allows you to spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose only a single point of access DNS to your application.
- Seamlessly handle downstream failures of instances
- Do regular health checks on downstream instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- High Availability across zones
- ELB is a managed load balancer which means:
	- AWS guarantees that it will be working
	- AWS handles upgrades, maintenance, high availability
	- AWS provides only a few config options
- It costs less to setup your own load balancer but will take more effort from you to maintain and integrate your own.

- *There are 4 Kinds of load balancers offered by AWS*
	- Application Load Balancer ALB (HTTP/HTTPS only) - layer 7
	- Network Load Balancer NLB (Ultra-high performance, allows for TCP/UDP) - layer 4
	- Gateway Load balancer  GLB - layer 3
	- Classic Load Balancer (RETIRED 2023) - layer 4 and 7
