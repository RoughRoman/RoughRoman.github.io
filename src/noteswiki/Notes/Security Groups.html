### Overview 
Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS

They control how traffic is allowed into or out of, our EC2 instances

Security groups contain only allow rules. 
Security group rules can reference by IP or by security group.

### deeper dive 

Security groups are acting as a firewall on EC2 instances.
They regulate:
* Access to ports 
* authorized IP ranges 
* control of inbound network traffic 
* control of outbound network traffic 

They can be attached to multiple EC2 instances

Security groups are locked to a region

They live outside the EC2 instance. 

It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access 

If your application is not accessible (timed out) then it's a security group issue.

If your application gives a connection refused error, then it's an application error or it's not launched.

All inbound traffic is blocked by default.
All outbound traffic is authorised by default.

Lastly, security groups can reference other security groups. Which allows security groups to authorise instances that have other groups without worrying about ports and IPs</md-block>
