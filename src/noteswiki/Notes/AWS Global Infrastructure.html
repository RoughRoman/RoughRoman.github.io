        <md-block>### Overview
AWS global infrastructure is made up of a few concepts
* AWS Regions:
	* AWS has regions all around the world. They have names like us-east-1 af-south-1 etc
	* A region is a cluster of data centres
	* Most AWS services are region-scoped
	* How do you choose an AWS region?
		* It depends, but here are some factors
			* Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
			* Proximity to customers: reduced latency
			* Available services within a region. Not all services are available in all regions. 
			* Pricing: pricing varies region to region

* AWS Availability Zones
	* Each Region has many availability zones, usually 3, min is 3 max is 6
	* Example: Region = ap-southeast-2 | 3 availability zones       =         ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c
	* Each of these zones are one or more discrete data centres with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
	* They are separate from each other so they are isolated from disasters
	* They are connected with high bandwidth, ultra low latency networks.

* AWS points of presence(Edge locations)
	* Amazon has 400+ points of presence. content is delivered to end users with lower latency.
