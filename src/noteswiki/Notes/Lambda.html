### Why
- EC2 = virtual servers in the cloud, Bound by Ram and CPU, Continuously running, scaling means intervention to add/remove servers
- Lambda =  Virtual functions, limited by time, run on-demand, scaling is automated. 

### Benefits
- Easy pricing:
	-  Pay per request and compute time.
	- Free tier of 1 million AWS lambda Requests and 400k GBs of compute time. monthly
- Integrated with whole AWS suite of services
- Event-Driven: functions get invoked by AWS when needed
- Integrated with many programming languages
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- Easy to get more resources per function (Up to 10GB of RAM)
- Increased RAM also improves CPU and network performance

### Supported languages
- Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby. 
- and provides a Runtime API which allows you to use any additional programming languages to author your functions.
- Additional runtime:
	- Lambda Container Image
		- Allows a container to run on lambda but the container must implement the Lambda Runtime API (ECS or Fargate is preferred)

### pricing
 - Pay per Calls: 
	 - First 1M requests are free.
	 - $0.20 per 1M requests thereafter. 
- Pay in duration: increments if 1ms
	- 400,000GB seconds of compute time per month if free
		- Meaning 400,000 Seconds if the function uses 1GB  RAM
		- or 3,200,000 Seconds if function uses 128MB RAM 
	- After. $1.00 for 600,000 GB-Seconds
- It is usually very cheap to run AWS lambda so its very popular. 
- Remember for exam its priced by calls and duration
