- Fully managed batch processing at any scale.
- Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on aws
- A batch job is a job with a start and an end. As opposed to Continuous streaming jobs.
- Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot instances.
- You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS batch does the rest.
- Batch Jobs are defined as docker images and run on ECS
- Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure.
