- Storing data on disk (EFS, EBS, EC2 instance Store, S3 can have its limits)
- Structured data is better for a database to efficiently query/search through the data
- You define relationships between your datasets
- Databases are optimized for a purpose and come with different features, shapes and constraints.

### Relational Databases
- Traditional relational data. 
- AWS RDS overview
	- RDS = relational database service
	- Its a managed DB Service for DBs that use SQL as a query language
	- It allows to create databases in the cloud that are managed by aws
	- Examples:
		- Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL servers
		- <a href = "Aurora.html">Aurora</a>
	- Why use RDS?
		- Automated provisioning, OS patching
		- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamps
		- Monitoring Dashboards
		- Read Replicas for improved read performance
		- Multi AZ setup for Disaster Recovery
		- maintenance windows for upgrades
		- Scaling capability Vertical and horizontal
		- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io l)
		- BUT YOU CAN'T SSH INTO IT<img src = "..\Images\Pasted image 20231128113445.png"></img>

### NoSQL Databases
- NoSQL = non-SQL = non relational databases
- NoSQL databases are purpose built for specific data models and have flexible schemas for building modern applications
- Benefits:
	- Flexibility: Easy to evolve data model
	- Scalability: Designed to scale-out by using distributed clusters
	- High performance: optimized for a specific data model
	- Highly Functional: types optimized for the data model.
- Examples: key-value, Document, Graph, in-memory, search databases.
