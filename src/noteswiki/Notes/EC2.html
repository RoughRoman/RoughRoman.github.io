* EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is the most popular AWS offering.
* It acts as Infrastructure as a Service
* It mainly consists in the capability of:
	* Renting virtual Machines EC2 (EC2 instances)
	* Store data on virtual Drives (EBS volumes)
	* Distribute load across machines (ELB Elastic Load Balancer)
	* Scaling the services using an Auto-Scaling Group (ASG)
* EC2 is fundamental to the cloud. 
* EC2s are powered by <a href = "AMI.html">AMI</a>s or amazon machine images
### EC2 sizing and config options
* OS options: Linux, Windows, or MacOS*
* How much compute power and core CPU
* How much RAM
* How much Storage space: 
	* Through network attached EBS and EFS
	* or hardware EC2 Instance Store
* network card, speed of the card, public IP
* Firewall rules: security group
* Bootstrap script (configure at first launch) <a href = "EC2 User Data Script.html">EC2 User Data Script</a>

There are a variety of <a href = "EC2 instance types.html">EC2 instance types</a>

The firewalls of EC2 Instances can be configured using Security Groups

EC2 instances can also have roles assigned to them to indicate what users are allowed to SSH into them.

EC2 Image Builder is used to automate the creation of VMs or container images
- Automate creation, maintenance, validation and testing of EC2 AMIs on a schedule if required. Free service. Other than the actual EC2 Instances created

### The shared Responsibility model for EC2:
- AWS is responsible for :
	- Infrastructure( global network security)
	- Isolation on physical hosts
	- Faulty hardware
	- Compliance validation
- You are responsible for :
	- Security group rules
	- Operating-system patches and updates
	- Software and utilities on the EC2 instance
	- IAM roles assigned to EC2 and IAM user access management 
	- Data security on your instance

EC2 Summary:
- An instance consists of the following:
	- AMI(OS)
	- Instance Size(CPU+RAM) + Storage
	- Security groups "Fire wall"
	- EC2 user data "boot strap script"
- Security groups are fire walls attached to the EC2 instance. Which defines ports available for inbound and outbound data
- EC2 user data script is run on first instance creation.
- SHH to start a terminal into our EC2 instance (port 22)
- EC2 instance roll to link to IAM roles
