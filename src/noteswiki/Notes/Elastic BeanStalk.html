### Developer Problems
* Managing infrastructure
* Deploying code
* Configuring all DBs, load balancers etc
* Scaling concerns
* Most web apps have the same architechture
* All the developer wants is for their code to run
* Possibly, across different applications and environments

### Beanstalk addresses this.
* Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Rolls many components used for webapps like EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS etc into a single view for a developer
* You still have full control over the configuration of these components. 
* Beanstalk itself is free. But you pay for the underlying services


### Overview
* Managed Service:
	* Instance config / OS is handled by Beanstalk
	* Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by beanstalk
	* Capacity provisioning
	* Load balancing and auto scaling
	* Application Health-monitoring and responsiveness.
* Your responsibility is just the application code.
* Three architecture models:
	* Single Instance deployment: good for Development
	* LB+ASG: great for production or pre-production web apps
	* ASG only: Great for non-web apps in production.
