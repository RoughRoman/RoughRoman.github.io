-  Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2 instances as opposed to an EBS which can only be mounted to one EC2 at a time. 
- EFS works only with Linux EC2 instances in multi-AZ
- Highly available, Scalable, Expensive, pay per use. no capacity planning. 

### Subtype of EFS is EFS-IA or infrequent access.
- Storage class that is cost-optimized for infrequently accessed files. 
- Up to 92% cost decrease
- EFS can be configured with a lifecycle policy that will automatically move files to EFS-IA based on the last time they were accessed.
- Its transparent to the user application. i.e. there is no difference to the end application as to what data is in EFS or EFS-IA. Behind the scenes there is just cost optimization going on.
