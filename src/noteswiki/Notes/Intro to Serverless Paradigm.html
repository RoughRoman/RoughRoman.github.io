### What is serverless?
- New paradigm in which developers don't have to manage servers anymore.
- They deploy code / functions only
- Serverless originally was FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Originally pioneered by AWS Lambda but now includes anything that's managed
- Does not mean there are no servers. Just means the user/developer doesn't managed them/ provision them/ Opaque

### Examples we have seen. 
- S3
- DynamoDB
- Fargate
