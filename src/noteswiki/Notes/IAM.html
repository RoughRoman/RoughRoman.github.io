Stands for Identity and Access Management. Its a global Service. 
on account creation a root account is created, but should not be used or shared.
We should instead create <a href = "Users.html">Users</a> which can be assigned <a href = "Groups.html">Groups</a>
Users and groups can be assigned <a href = "Permissions.html">Permissions</a>
Permissions can also be assigned to services via <a href = "Roles.html">Roles</a>

Techniques for improving Security
* IAM <a href = "Password Policy.html">Password Policy</a>
* <a href = "Multi-Factor Authentication.html">Multi-Factor Authentication</a>
### Security tools
* Iam Credentials Report (Account level)
	* A report that lists all your accounts users and the status of their various credentials
* IAM Access Advisor (User level)
	* Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
### Best Practices
* Dont use the root account
* One physical user = one aws user
* assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
* Create a strong password policy
* use and enforce the use of multi factor authentication
* create and use roles for giving permissions to aws services
* use Access keys for programmatic access
* audit permissions of account using IAM credentials report and IAM access advisor
* Never share IAM users and access keys</md-block>
