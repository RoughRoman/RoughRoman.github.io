* CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS infrastructure, for any resources.
* Example:
	* Create a security group
	* Then Create 3 EC2 instances using that security group
	* I want an S3 bucket
	* I want a load balancer ELB in front of these machines
	* *Then CloudFormation will create these for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify.*

### Benefits
* infrastructure as code
	* No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control
	* Changes to infrastructure are reviewed through code
* Cost
	* Each resource within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you.
	* You can estimate costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template.
	* Savings Strategy: in development, you could automate the deletion and recreation of templates during times high or low load. 
* Productivity
	* Ability to destroy and recreate an infrastructure on the cloud on the fly
	* Automated generation of diagrams for your templates
	* Declarative programming
* Don't reinvent the wheel
	* leverage existing templates on the web!
	* Leverage the documentation
* Supports (Almost) all AWS resources
	* You can use custom resources for resources that are not supported. </md-block>
