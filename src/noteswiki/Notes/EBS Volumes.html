- <a href = "EBS Volumes.html">EBS Volumes</a> : Elastic Block Store is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run.
- It allows your instances to persist data even after termination.
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
- Bound to a specific availability zone.
- Analogy: "network USB Stick"
- Free tier 30GB of free EBS storage of type general purpose(SSD) or magnetic per month
- Since its a network drive it uses the network to communicate with the instance, which means there might be some latency.
- Can be detached from one EC2 and attached to another quickly. For example if one instance fails you can quickly attach it to a new one.
- Can not be used across availability zones unless you use a <a href = "Snap shot.html">Snap shot</a> to move it. 
- Has a provisioned capacity (Size in GBs and IOPS {input/output operations})
- Billed for the provisioned capacity. and can increase that capacity.
- While an EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time. An EC2 instances can have multiple EBS volumes attached. 
- You can also have EBS volumes with no EC2 instance attached. 

- Delete on termination attribute
	- Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 Instance terminates. 
		- By default the root EBS volume is deleted
		- By default any other attached EBS volume is not deleted. 
		- Can be toggled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
