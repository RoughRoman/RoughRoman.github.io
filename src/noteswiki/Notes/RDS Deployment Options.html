- ### Read Replicas: 
	- Scale the read workload of your DB to allow applications to read from mutliple DB copies to distribute the read workload
	- Can create up to 15 Read replicas
	- Data is only written to the main DB

- ### Multi-AZ:
	- Provides a failover in case of AZ outage. (Provides high availability)
	- Data is only read/written to the main database
	- You can only have 1 other AZ as failover

- ### Multi-Region
	- Instead of read replicas within the same AZ. Now we have read replicas across Regions
	- Provides disaster Recovery in case of region issue
	- Local performance for global reads.
	- Replication cost needs to be considered. 
	- (I'd assume the latency of writes is obviously higher then. But I also assume writes happen less often than read.)
