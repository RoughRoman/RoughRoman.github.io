Users have access to your account and can cause changes. So you want to protect your root and IAM user accounts

So you use MFA which consists of a password **you know**+ a security device **you own**

benefit of MFA is that even if a password is compromised. the account is safe because the physical device is required for log-in

### MFA device options
* Virtual MFA Device - authentication software for phones or other devices.
	* Google authenticator (Phones only) or Authy(Multi-device + support for multiple tokens on a single account)
* Universal 2nd factor (U2F) Security key
