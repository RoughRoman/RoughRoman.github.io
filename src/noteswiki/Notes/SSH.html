- To SSH into a ec2 instance. You need a .pem file (name must not have a space in it ). (you get the pem file from the EC2 creation process.).
- Then you can use power shell (windows) or linux terminal or mac terminal and type in: 
Example:
`ssh -i .\EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@34.228.144.174`
basically it says. SSH into your ec2 shell on ip:  `34.228.144.174` as user: `ec2-user` using permissions from file `EC2Tutorial.pem`

Once successful. You are directly connected to the terminal of the OS running on the EC2 instance. And can type commands into it as if it was your own local pc.

### EC2 Instance connect. 
Alternatively, instead of SSH from your local pcs terminal into the EC2. You can use a browser based solution provided by AWS called EC2 Instance connect. 
go to your EC2 instance list on the console then click `connect` then select the EC2 Instance connect Tab then finally click connect. No need for keys
